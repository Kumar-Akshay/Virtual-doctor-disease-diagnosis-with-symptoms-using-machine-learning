# Virtual Docter Disease Diagnosis With Symptoms Using Machine Learning

This project represents a seamless integration of front-end development in PHP and back-end implementation in Python, creating a powerful synergy for our web application. The core functionality revolves around employing the Naive Bayes machine learning algorithm to diagnose diseases based on symptoms provided by users.

On the front end, the PHP framework is leveraged to design an intuitive and user-friendly interface. Users can effortlessly input their symptoms through the web application, providing essential information for the disease diagnosis process.

On the back end, Python comes into play, where sophisticated machine learning algorithms, specifically Naive Bayes, are utilized to analyze the user-provided symptoms. The algorithm processes this data, accurately diagnosing diseases and providing valuable insights into potential health conditions.

The combination of PHP for the front-end interface and Python for the powerful machine learning backend ensures a robust, interactive, and efficient web application. Users can receive accurate diagnoses, making informed decisions about their health and well-being through our intuitive and user-centric platform."
